# AirPassengers Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs *basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)* on the classical *AirPassengers* dataset in R.  
The dataset includes monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

The goal of this project is to understand the structure of the data, identify patterns, and visualize the overall trend.

## Objectives
- Load and inspect the AirPassengers dataset
- Generate summary statistics
- Visualize the time series
- Identify basic patterns such as:
  - Trend
  - Seasonal variation
  - Monthly/Yearly passenger changes

## Methods Used
- Summary statistics (summary())
- Time series plotting
- Basic data exploration functions
- Line plots for understanding long-term trend

## Tools and Libraries
- R
- Base R time series functions
- ggplot2 (if used)
- ts object functions

## Key Findings (You can change these based on your results)
- Passenger numbers increase consistently over the years.
- Clear seasonal pattern with peaks in mid-year months.
- Overall upward trend in air travel over time.

## Files
- airpassengers.R — full R code for the EDA
